MBTI Project uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Laravel] - PHP web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax!
- [Tailwind css] - A utility-first CSS framework packed.
- [Trumbowyg Editor] - awesome web-based text editor.
- [Flowbite js] - library of components built on top of the utility-classes
- [jQuery] - duh

And of course MBTI itself is open source on GitHub.
